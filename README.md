# eslint-config-ufhealth-wordpress

A shareable eslint config for WordPress-specific UF Health projects.

Extends the [base ufhealth standard](https://github.com/ufhealth/eslint-config-ufhealth).

## Install

```bash
yarn add -D eslint-config-ufhealth-wordpress
```

## Usage

[Shareable configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) are designed for use with the `extends` option of your `.eslintrc`. After installing, just add this to your `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "extends": "ufhealth-wordpress"
}
```

That's basically it. Override any settings you want from this configuration by just adding them directly to your `.eslintrc` file.
